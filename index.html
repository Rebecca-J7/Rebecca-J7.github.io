    <!--About Section-->
    <h3 id = "About Section" style = "color:black"> About Section</h3>
    <p> My name is Rebecca Jennings, and I am currently a third-year student attending the University of California, Riverside, pursuing my bachelor's in Computer Science. I am passionate about pursuing a career in software development or cybersecurity, where my goal is to contribute to innovation while bridging the gaps between ethics and technology. I am an ambitious individual who employs adaptability, hard work, collaboration, leadership, and passion to learn through any given opportunity. I am continuing to broaden my skills in C++, UI/UX, Arduino/hardware, through multiple positions in engineering organizations, and participating in hackathons!</p>

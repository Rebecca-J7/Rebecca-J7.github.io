# CS110 - Personal Page: Rebecca's Portfolio

# Phase 1

For the first phase you’ll be creating only the HTML portion of your profile page without any CSS elements. Start by creating a GitHub repository for your site by following steps 1-2 of the GitHub Pages getting started page (you’ll be using GitHub pages to publish your site).
If you are already using GitHub Pages for another site you are hosting you can use a regular repository for this assignment instead.

Created an index.html file which contains the following: <br/>

Header Section <br/>
Title <br/>
charset <br/>
Body Section <br/>
Headshot photo (or Avatar) <br/>
Your name (h1) <br/>
Some type of subheading (h2) <br/>
Socials (your choice) <br/>
About section (h3 followed by a paragraph) <br/>
Work Experience (h3 followed by a table or flexbox) <br/>
First row should contain company name, title, and dates of employment <br/>
Second row should be a description of what you did at that job (and take up all three columns) <br/>
Education (h3 followed by a table or flexbox) <br/>
Coursework (h3 followed by an unordered list) <br/>
Note in my example I use “courses taught” instead of coursework <br/>
Skills (h3 followed by an unordered list) <br/>
Projects (h3 followed by an unordered list or table) <br/>
